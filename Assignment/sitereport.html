<p> First,let me introduce myself.My name is Khagendra Chhetri.I am the student of University of Northampton.
    My course name is BSc Hons Computing(Software Engineering).My student id is "21427623".
    I’m a full-time student in the University of Northampton.
    I am first year student of my university.I’ll start off with my journey,
     including what went wrong along the way.
    <br><br> If you're only interested in my recommendations for the quickest route to your destination,

If you're interested in learning how to become a web developer from the ground up, skip to the last section: The quickest path.

So without further ado, let's get this party started!

<br><br>Learning the Fundamentals
The first thing that sprang to me after deciding to pursue a career in web development was, 
"What do I learn?" Following some investigation,
I ended up basing my study route on the requirements of the majority of entry-level web development positions.

that was:

<br>HTML & CSS (#.HTML & CSS)

<br>Patterns in Design

<br>GitHub

<br>This is how it went down.

<br><br>HTML & CSS (#.HTML & CSS)

<br>I then went on to study HTML, CSS, and web design foundations.
HTML and CSS learning path at the University of Northampton.
These courses are still among my favourites since the pacing is excellent, 
and the total scope of what they teach enabled me to build a stronger foundation in this area.
You could simply replace this with anything like a university's HTML and CSS course and obtain similar results.
If you're looking for a challenge, Universities'
Intro to HTML and CSS course is significantly more comprehensive and slightly more difficult.

<br><br>#.Patterns in Design
<br>Design patterns are reusable code solutions that can be utilised to tackle common software problems over and over again.
You will be a lot more competitive software developer in any programming language if you have this foundation.

<br><br>#.GitHub
<br>GitHub is a tool I didn't realise I needed until I saw what it could achieve.
GitHub basically allows you to keep track of the changes you make to your code 
so that you can roll back to an earlier point in time if something goes wrong.
It also allows you to view the history of your code.

<br><br>#.Difficulties I encountered during my first year of graduation 
<br> I was ready for my first web development assignment for an entry-level level 
once I had learned the principles of web programming.
On my first endeavour, I must admit, I was extremely scared.

<br>Thankfully, I had an understanding team lead on my first job who helped me overcome these challenges.
He never failed to encourage me to try new things, even if they didn't always work out.
He also encouraged me to challenge everything, including his own beliefs.
I eventually learned my lesson.
Since then, I've always been someone who relishes the opportunity to try new things.
I'm always trying to figure out why best practises exist, when they're appropriate, and when they don't.

<br><br>#.Taking it a Step further
<br>In the years that followed, I worked hard to develop myself.

<br><br>#.Conclusions
<br> I'd just like to add that I had a lot of fun creating this, and it makes me extremely 
glad to have finally been able to repay the programming community's incredible generosity.
This is my first blog entry, as some of you may have observed,
 but rest assured that I want to write more. Just don't hold your breath for one every week.
  Always prioritise quality above quantity.
