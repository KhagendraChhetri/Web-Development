    Many students see planning as a waste of time, but it actually saves you time. 
    Take a few minutes to think about the topic and what you want to say about it. 
    You can write an outline, draw a chart or use a graphic organizer to arrange your ideas. 
    This gives you a chance to spot problems in your ideas before you spend time writing out the paragraphs."
